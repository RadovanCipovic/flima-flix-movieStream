# FlimaFlix - Online Streaming Platform

## Description
FlimaFlix is an online streaming platform developed as my first course project. The platform allows users to watch movies online and includes features such as user and super admin registration, movie management, and more. This project helped me grasp some foundational concepts in the world of programming, and while it's not perfect, it was a significant learning experience.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Secure user registration using JWT tokens.
- **Super Admin Panel**: CRUD operations for movies including adding, editing, listing, and deleting movies. These options are only accessible by the super admin.
- **Movie Streaming**: Users can stream movies directly on the platform.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built with Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies
- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Experience and Challenges
This project, being my first course project, was an incredible learning journey. I initially planned to create an application for hotels, which is why some file names may still reference "hotel" (e.g., `hotel.component.ts`). However, I pivoted to create a movie streaming platform instead. This project is not without its flaws, but it allowed me to understand and implement several key concepts in programming and web development. It taught me the importance of planning, adaptability, and perseverance.
